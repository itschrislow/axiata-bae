# Bullying Avoidance & Education (BAE)

This solution is developed for [Axiata Coding Challenge](https://www.axiata.com/talent/axiatavirtualgirlscodingchallenge/) to combat cyberbullying.

## Overview

BAE is a scenario-based learning platform to educate students how to recognize bullying and its effects on others. Students are also able to schedule counselling sessions if needed and report bullying incidents. On the other hand, selected educators are able to view the results of the quizzes, respond to session requests and take action on reported incidents.
